Jenkins is an open-source automation server used primarily for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software by integrating with various version control systems, such as Git. 
Jenkins supports numerous plugins that extend its functionality and enable the automation of tasks like code compilation, testing, and deployment across multiple environments.
It is widely used in DevOps practices to streamline software development workflows.
